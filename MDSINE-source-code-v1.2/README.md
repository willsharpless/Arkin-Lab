## Installation ##
To install, please download the latest release at https://bitbucket.org/MDSINE/mdsine/downloads, and follow the installation procedure.

WARNING: There is an issue with the linux installer that occasionally will claim that you have an issue with your connection, and the installation will halt. It should take a few tries, but once it starts it should complete successfully.

For execution and usage details, please see the manual (in the doc folder in the source or the installation folder.)
